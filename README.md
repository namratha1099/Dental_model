# Dental Radiographs analysis using Neural Networks 
## Overview
This repository contains project code with .ipynb file written in Python using google collaboratory that is having code that predicts output of an dental x-ray whether person having caries or not based on probability output value between 0 and 1 when dental radiograph is given as input to web application.

## Project Objectives-
- **Analyze Dental X-rays:** Apply advanced neural networks and transfer learning to analyze dental radiographs.
- **Use Transfer Learning:** Employ transfer learning models to take advantage of pre-trained weights for improved accuracy.
- **Accurate Caries Detection:** Utilize MobileNet and other architectural models to segregate radiographs with caries, providing a probability output.
- **Efficient Application:** Offer a quick and accurate web application to assist dentists in evaluating x-rays, thereby saving time.
