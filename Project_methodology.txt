TECHNIQUES-

1.Neural Networks: Implemented various neural network architectures for training data and developing model.
2.Transfer Learning: Applied different transfer learning models to utilize pre-trained weights and improve model performance depending upon the accuracy of the model that provides better 3.prediction results.
4.Mobile Net Architecture: Achieved error-free results with better accuracy compared to others with Mobile Net architecture, demonstrating high accuracy in caries detection.
5.Architectures: Along with Mobile Net architecture, VGG16,ResNet,GoogleNet are the other implemented transfer learning models for optimized results.

METHODOLOGY-

STEP 1-Data Preparation: Collected dataset of x-ray images from hospitals in form of .pano images and converted into .jpg images with TWV software and uploaded data into Google Collaboratory
STEP 2-Importing Modules: Imported Keras module necessary for using algorithms from python using pip to install different modules.
STEP 3-Data Splitting: Trained data by dividing data into Train-validation-test approach that takes 60% of dataset for training 20% for validation and 20% for testing data.
STEP 4-Model Development: Developed model used CNN layers with transfer learning algorithms for yielding better results with using pooling layers, sigmoid activation function and binary   classification.
STEP 5-Training model: Trained model with epochs that can better make the model and saved model with .h5 extension that can be used elsewhere. Final model is having convolutional layer with                        mobile net architecture.
STEP 6-Model prediction: Provided x-ray as input to model for prediction that gives out output value between 0 and 1. This was developed as web application using Flask as web framework
